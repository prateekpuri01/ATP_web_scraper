This folder contains the extracted match statistics data, sorted by year. Match data is provided both before and after some light data cleaning was performed, for reference. Additional cleaning should be performed if serious analysis is going to be conducted. 

Error files are also included for each year that store that match links that were unable to be extracted from the scraper. 
Some light post-processing was applied to the match files to correct for obvious errors (0 values, incorrectly labeled stats, etc.) 
but more serious post-processing can be done if additional rigor is required.
